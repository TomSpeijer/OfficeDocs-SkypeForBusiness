In terms of Microsoft Teams **core** functionalities, there are no differences between the different Office 365 subscriptions, the availability of the compliance capabilities does rely on the correct subscription level. (See [Information Protection Licensing](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Plan-for-Office-365-security-and-information-protection-capabilities-3d4ac4a1-3920-4ff9-918f-011f3ce60408) for more information.)

All supported subscription plans are eligible for access to Microsoft Teamsâ€™ web client, desktop clients, and mobile apps.

Microsoft Teams is not available as a standalone service.

Microsoft Teams license
---------------------

By default, the Microsoft Teams license is enabled for all users assigned with the eligible Office 365 subscriptions.

Microsoft Teams can be enabled or disabled for the entire organization and is enabled by default. **You can't turn on Microsoft Teams for only part of an organization.** If an organization intends to operate a pilot of Microsoft Teams with a selective set of users, while actively restricting access to Microsoft Teams for other users, then the Microsoft Teams license must be disabled for all users who are not part of the pilot group.
